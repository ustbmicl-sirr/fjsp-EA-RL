Installation
================


To install all necessary packages run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

.. note::

    Schlably was developed in Python 3.10. It may work with higher versions of Python 3, but this is not guaranteed.

If you want to use `Weights&Biases <https://wandb.ai/site>`_ (wandb) for logging, which we highly recommend,
you need to (create and) login with your account. Open a terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    wandb login
